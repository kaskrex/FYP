Developed a Smart Luggage Tag system as my Final Year Project, featuring a cross-platform mobile application that generates a QR code containing information stored in Luggage Tags & transmits the QR Code to an Arduino Mega 2560 board via Bluetooth Low Energy; displaying the QR code on an E-Paper display screen. Built using React Native, functionalities of this system include a Passwordless Login System to eliminate the need for users to remember overly-complicated passwords whilst enhancing the system’s security simultaneously, a map that automatically maps out the F&B outlets within airports, relative to the user’s current location & a lightweight, cloud-based backend (Twilio, Google Cloud Platform, Firebase) to ensure that users do not experience long loading times.
